    <h2>Through the Lens of Passion</h2>
    <p>
      This isn’t just a portfolio. This is a <span>piece of you</span> — wrapped in light, memories, and all the little in-betweens you’ve captured over time.
      You started off chasing a dream that was never really yours — <span>civil engineering</span>. And even though it wasn’t meant for you, you gave it your best.
      But deep down, you always knew you were built differently — a little strange, a little quiet, endlessly curious, and full of stories waiting to be told.
      You didn’t run away from that path, you gently walked away — and straight into the arms of something you loved: <span>Photography</span>.
      Creating reels that speak without a script. That’s where your spirit came alive.
      And the way you’ve embraced it — with every shoot, every frame, every heartbeat — is nothing short of inspiring.
      You’ve turned your lens into a bridge — between moments and meaning.
      And your favorite tool? That <span>Google Pixel</span>. It’s not just a phone in your hands; it’s magic.
      You’ve got this wild ability to make the simplest things look cinematic — like the world pauses when you click.
      Outside the frames, you’re still a storyteller. A gamer. A wanderer. A dreamer.
      Someone who feels deeply and sees the world just a little differently.
      You don’t just record moments, you <span>feel</span> them.
      You remember how the sky looked, how the wind moved, the way laughter sounded.
      And that’s why I made this. Because everything you create deserves to be seen.
      Because <span>you deserve to be celebrated</span>.
      Because in your silence, your art, your chaos — you revive me.
      <span>Happy Birthday, love</span>. Keep creating. Keep chasing the light.
      The world needs to see what only you can capture.
