    ðŸ’Œ Hey you,
    If you're reading this, youâ€™ve officially found the secret message.
    I just wanted to say â€” Iâ€™m insanely proud of you.
    Your art, your silence, your chaosâ€¦ they inspire me more than words ever could.
    You see the world differently â€” and thatâ€™s your magic. Never let go of it.
    Youâ€™re not just my favorite artist, youâ€™re my favorite human.
    â€” With all my heart, always,
      Tannu â™¡

    <h2>Through the Lens of Passion</h2>
    <p>This isnâ€™t just a portfolio. This is a <span>piece of you</span> â€” wrapped in light, memories, and all the little in-betweens youâ€™ve captured over time.</p>
    <p>You started off chasing a dream that wasnâ€™t truly yours â€” <span>Civil Engineering</span>. Even though it didnâ€™t feel right, you gave it your all.</p>
    <p>But youâ€™ve always been different â€” a little quiet, deeply observant, curious, and full of stories waiting to unfold. So when you gently stepped away from that world and into the arms of <span>photography</span>, everything just clicked.</p>
    <p>With every frame you create, every reel you edit, and every scene you freeze, you donâ€™t just document life â€” you breathe emotion into it.</p>
    <p>Youâ€™ve turned your <span>Google Pixel</span> into a paintbrush, the world into your canvas, and ordinary moments into timeless art.</p>
    <p>What amazes me is how you make even silence speak â€” how a shadow, a glance, or a soft beam of sunlight tells a whole story through your eyes.</p>
    <p>Outside the frame, youâ€™re still an artist â€” a gamer, a wanderer, a dreamer with a heart full of feeling. Someone who remembers how the sky looked that day, how laughter sounded, or how the wind moved just before the shot.</p>
    <p>You donâ€™t just record moments, loveâ€¦ you <span>feel</span> them.</p>
    <p>This page, this site â€” itâ€™s here because everything you create deserves to be seen. Because <span>you</span> deserve to be celebrated.</p>
    <p>And in your silence, your art, your chaos â€” you revive me. You remind me that thereâ€™s beauty in stillness and power in feeling.</p>
    <p><span>Happy Birthday, love</span>. Keep creating. Keep chasing the light.  
      The world needs to see what only you can capture.</p>
